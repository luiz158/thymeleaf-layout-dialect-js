Thymeleaf Layout Dialect JS
===========================

In-browser version of the [Thymeleaf Layout Dialect](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect),
used for static prototyping.

 - Current version: (still under development)
 - Released: (n/a)


Current goals
-------------

 - be as easy to use as dropping a script into a page
 - parse all the `layout` directives (I think the `data-layout` variations will be easiest)
 - start by working using http on localhost (ie: work on the `file:///` problem later)
